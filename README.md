# sol# Food, LLC - Our Menu

This is a responsive single-page website for "Food, LLC" that displays a simple menu with three sections: Chicken, Beef, and Sushi. The layout adapts to different screen sizes: Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile. The page includes a fixed navigation bar that collapses into a mobile-friendly menu on smaller screens.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The page adjusts to desktop, tablet, and mobile screen sizes using Bootstrap’s grid system.
- **Collapsible Navbar**: The navigation bar scrolls away with the page, and on mobile, it becomes a hamburger menu.
- **Section Layout**: Three sections (Chicken, Beef, Sushi) with dummy content.
- **Smooth Navigation**: The links in the navbar allow you to jump to each section of the page.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Used to structure the content and layout of the page.
- **CSS3**: Used for styling and to ensure responsiveness across devices.
- **Bootstrap 3.3.7**: A CSS framework for building responsive, mobile-first websites. Bootstrap's grid system and components are used for layout and navigation.
- **jQuery**: Used for Bootstrap's JavaScript components (e.g., collapsible navbar).
